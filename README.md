# Federated Learning in Healthcare with Flower

[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/kifLAY_5JA0/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/kifLAY_5JA0)
Result from the project was presented at [Flower Summit, Cambridge 2022](https://flower.dev/conf/flower-summit-2022/).

Harnessing the potential of AI in healthcare requires access to huge amounts of data to build robust models. One solution to overcome the problems of sharing healthcare data to develop better models is federated learning. In this scenario, different models are trained on each hospital's local data and share their knowledge (parameters) with a central server that performs the aggregation in order to achieve a more robust and fair model.

This repository contains the code to reproduce the experiments performed in the framework of the Decentralized AI in Healthcare project at Sahlgrenska University Hospital and AI Sweden. In this example repository we are working on publicly available data (ISIC Archive) and simulating the decentralised setup internally. We have two different tasks on which we are actively working :

* Synthetic data generation using GANs with FL/SL setup.

* Image classification in FL/SL setup. 

Our main use case is connected with Melanoma Diagnosis using ISIC Dataset:

* **ISIC 2020**: Download the [ISIC 2020 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/nroman/melanoma-external-malignant-256) 

## Flower framework
Flower is a user-friendly framework designed for implementing the Federated Learning approach.

```docker run -d --rm -it --volume $(pwd):/workspace --shm-size 8G --name decentralized_ai_dermatology decentralized_ai_dermatology```

Execute container

```docker exec -it decentralized_ai_dermatology bash```


### Federated learning pipeline

A federated learning system needs two parts
1. **Server**. The server hosts the aggregation logic and makes sure all the devices have the latest and updated model parameters.
2. **Client**. The clients (devices or silos - hospitals in our specific use case) have a local model running on the local data.

In our use case, we will be following the below steps.
1. We will build a melanoma classifier based on EfficientNetB2 using ISIC 2020 Dataset. 
3. We will first train the model on the local data in each client. Lets start with 3 hospitals, so we have 3 locally running models in 3 seperate institutions.
4. Once our model is trained and we have our model parameters, we try to connect with the server.
5. The server then either accepts or rejects the invitation to connect based on some policy. Here we will simply use a First Come First Serve policy.
6. If the connection goes through, the client sends the model parameters to the server.
7. The server waits for all 3 model parameters and then aggregates them thus making use of all the data in all the models.
8. This can happen for as many rounds as we want to train the data.
9. Then the server sends the updates weight parameters back to the clients.
10. The client will now use the weights for image classification.

### Flower Server 

For simple workloads we can start a Flower server and leave all the configuration possibilities at their default values. In a file named ```server.py```, import Flower and start the server:

```python
import flwr as fl

fl.server.start_server(config={"num_rounds": 3})
```
<!--- Add additional args ADVANCED-->
There are three ways to customize the way Flower orchestrates the learning process on the server side:
   * Use an existing strategy, for example, FedAvg
   * Customize an existing strategy with callback functions
   * Implement a novel strategy
   
The strategy abstraction enables implementation of fully custom strategies. A strategy is basically the federated learning algorithm that runs on the server. Strategies decide how to sample clients, how to configure clients for training, how to aggregate updates, and how to evaluate models. Flower provides a few built-in strategies which are based on the same API described below.

#### Built-in strategies

Flower comes with a number of popular federated learning strategies built-in. A built-in strategy can be instantiated as follows:

```python
import flwr as fl

strategy = fl.server.strategy.FedAvg()
fl.server.start_server(config={"num_rounds": 3}, strategy=strategy)
```
This creates a strategy with all parameters left at their default values and passes it to the _start_server_ function. It is usually recommended to adjust a few parameters during instantiation. Existing strategies provide several ways to customize their behaviour. Callback functions allow strategies to call user-provided code during execution.

The server can pass new configuration values to the client each round by providing a function to _on_fit_config_fn_. The provided function will be called by the strategy and must return a dictionary of configuration key values pairs that will be sent to the client. It must return a dictionary of arbitraty configuration values _client.fit_ and _client.evaluate_ functions during each round of federated learning.

```python
import flwr as fl

def get_on_fit_config_fn() -> Callable[[int], Dict[str, str]]:
    """Return a function which returns training configurations."""

    def fit_config(rnd: int) -> Dict[str, str]:
        """Return a configuration with static batch size and (local) epochs."""
        config = {
            "learning_rate": str(0.001),
            "batch_size": str(32),
        }
        return config

    return fit_config

strategy = fl.server.strategy.FedAvg(
    fraction_fit=0.1,
    min_fit_clients=10,
    min_available_clients=80,
    on_fit_config_fn=get_on_fit_config_fn(),
)
fl.server.start_server(config={"num_rounds": 3}, strategy=strategy)
```
The _on_fit_config_fn_ can be used to pass arbitrary configuration values from server to client, and potentially change these values each round, for example, to adjust the learning rate. The client will receive the dictionary returned by the _on_fit_config_fn_ in its own _client.fit()_ function.

Similar to _on_fit_config_fn_, there is also _on_evaluate_config_fn_ to customize the configuration sent to _client.evaluate()_.

Server-side evaluation can be enabled by passing an evaluation function to _eval_fn_.

#### Implement a novel strategy

All strategy implementation are derived from the abstract base class _flwr.server.strategy.Strategy_, both built-in implementations and third party implementations. This means that custom strategy implementations have the exact same capabilities at their disposal as built-in ones.

The strategy abstraction defines a few abstract methods that need to be implemented:

```python
class Strategy(ABC):

    @abstractmethod
    def configure_fit(
        self, rnd: int, weights: Weights, client_manager: ClientManager
    ) -> List[Tuple[ClientProxy, FitIns]]:

    @abstractmethod
    def aggregate_fit(
        self,
        rnd: int,
        results: List[Tuple[ClientProxy, FitRes]],
        failures: List[BaseException],
    ) -> Optional[Weights]:

    @abstractmethod
    def configure_evaluate(
        self, rnd: int, weights: Weights, client_manager: ClientManager
    ) -> List[Tuple[ClientProxy, EvaluateIns]]:

    @abstractmethod
    def aggregate_evaluate(
        self,
        rnd: int,
        results: List[Tuple[ClientProxy, EvaluateRes]],
        failures: List[BaseException],
    ) -> Optional[float]:

    @abstractmethod
    def evaluate(self, weights: Weights) -> Optional[Tuple[float, float]]:
```
Creating a new strategy means implmenting a new class derived from the abstract base class _Strategy_ which provides implementations for the previously shown abstract methods:
```python
class SotaStrategy(Strategy):

    def configure_fit(self, rnd, weights, client_manager):
        # Your implementation here

    def aggregate_fit(self, rnd, results, failures):
        # Your implementation here

    def configure_evaluate(self, rnd, weights, client_manager):
        # Your implementation here

    def aggregate_evaluate(self, rnd, results, failures):
        # Your implementation here

    def evaluate(self, weights):
        # Your implementation here
```        
More on implementing strategies: [Implementing Strategies - flower.dev](https://flower.dev/docs/implementing-strategies.html) 

### Flower Client

The Flower server interacts with clients through an interface called ```Client```. When the server selects a particular client for training, it sends training instructions over the network. The client receives those instructions and calls one of the ```Client``` methods to run your code (i.e., to train the melanoma classification network).

Flower provides a convenience class called ```NumPyClient``` which makes it easier to implement the ```Client``` interface when your workload uses PyTorch. Implementing ```NumPyClient``` usually means defining the following methods (```set_parameters``` is optional though):

* **get_parameters**: 
    * return the model weight as a list of NumPy ndarrays

* **set_parameters (optional)**: 
    * update the local model weights with the parameters received from the server

* **fit**: 
    * set the local model weights
    * train the local model 
    * receive the updated local model weights

* **evaluate**:
    * test the local model

which can be implemented in the following way:

```python
class Client(fl.client.NumPyClient):
    """Flower client implementing melanoma classification using PyTorch."""

    def __init__(
        self,
        model: Net,
        trainloader: torch.utils.data.DataLoader,
        valloader: torch.utils.data.DataLoader,
        testloader: torch.utils.data.DataLoader,
        num_examples: Dict, 
    ) -> None:
        self.model = model
        self.trainloader = trainloader
        self.valloader = valloader
        self.testloader = testloader
        self.num_examples = num_examples

    def get_properties(self, config):
        return {} 
    
    def get_parameters(self) -> List[np.ndarray]:
        return [val.cpu().numpy() for _, val in net.state_dict().items()]


    def set_parameters(self, parameters: List[np.ndarray]) -> None:
        params_dict = zip(net.state_dict().keys(), parameters)
        state_dict = OrderedDict({k: torch.tensor(v) for k, v in params_dict})
        net.load_state_dict(state_dict, strict=True)

    def fit(
        self, parameters: List[np.ndarray], config: Dict[str, str]
    ) -> Tuple[List[np.ndarray], int, Dict]:
        # Set model parameters, train model, return updated model parameters
        self.set_parameters(parameters)
        self.model = train(self.model, self.trainloader, self.valloader, self.num_examples)
        return self.get_parameters(), self.num_examples["trainset"], {}

    def evaluate(
        self, parameters: List[np.ndarray], config: Dict[str, str]
    ) -> Tuple[float, int, Dict]: 
        # Set model parameters, evaluate model on local test dataset, return result
        self.set_parameters(parameters)
        loss, auc, accuracy, f1 = val(self.model, self.testloader)

        return float(loss), self.num_examples["testset"], {"accuracy": float(accuracy), "auc": float(auc), "f1": float(f1)}
                
```

We can now create an instance of our class Client and add one line to actually run this client:

```python
fl.client.start_numpy_client("[::]:8080", client=Client())
```
That’s it for the client. We only have to implement Client or NumPyClient and call fl.client.start_client() or fl.client.start_numpy_client(). The string "[::]:8080" tells the client which server to connect to. In our case we can run the server and the client on the same machine, therefore we use "[::]:8080". If we run a truly federated workload with the server and clients running on different machines, all that needs to change is the server_address we point the client at.

### Evaluation

There are two main approaches to evaluate models in federated learning systems: centralized (or server-side) evaluation and federated (or client-side) evaluation. 

#### Centralized Evaluation

All built-in strategies support centalized evaluation by providing an evaluation function during initialization. An evaluation function is any function that can take the current global model parameters as input and return evaluation results:

```python
def get_eval_fn(model: torch.nn.Module, toy: bool):
    """Return an evaluation function for server-side evaluation."""

    # Load data and model here to avoid the overhead of doing it in `evaluate` itself
    trainset, _, _ = utils.load_data()

    n_train = len(trainset) 
    # Use the last 5k training examples as a validation set
    valset = torch.utils.data.Subset(trainset, range(n_train - 5000, n_train))

    # The `evaluate` function will be called after every round
    def evaluate(
        weights: fl.common.Weights,
    ) -> Optional[Tuple[float, Dict[str, fl.common.Scalar]]]:
        # Update model with the latest parameters
        params_dict = zip(model.state_dict().keys(), weights)
        state_dict = OrderedDict({k: torch.tensor(v) for k, v in params_dict})
        model.load_state_dict(state_dict, strict=True)

        loss, accuracy = utils.test(model, valset)
        return loss, {"accuracy": accuracy}

    return

# Load the model for server-side parameter evaluation
 model = utils.load_efficientnet(classes=10).to(device)

# Create strategy
strategy = fl.server.strategy.FedAvg(
    # ... other FedAvg arguments
    eval_fn=get_eval_fn(model),
)

# Start Flower server for four rounds of federated learning
fl.server.start_server("[::]:8080", strategy=strategy)
```

#### Custom Strategies 
The _Strategy_ abstraction provides a method called _evaluate_ that can direcly be used to evaluate the current global model parameters. The current server implementation calls _evaluate_ after parameter aggregation and before federated evaluation (see next section).

#### Federated Evaluation

Client-side evaluation happens in the ```Client.evaluate``` method and can be configured from the server side.  Built-in strategies support the following arguments:

  * ```fraction_eval```: a float defining the fraction of clients that will be selected for evaluation. If fraction_eval is set to 0.1 and 100 clients are connected to the server, then 10 will be randomly selected for evaluation. If fraction_eval is set to 0.0, federated evaluation will be disabled.
  * ``` min_eval_clients```: an int: the minimum number of clients to be selected for evaluation. If fraction_eval is set to 0.1, min_eval_clients is set to 20, and 100 clients are connected to the server, then 20 clients will be selected for evaluation.
  * ```min_available_clients```: an int that defines the minimum number of clients which need to be connected to the server before a round of federated evaluation can start. If fewer than min_available_clients are connected to the server, the server will wait until more clients are connected before it continues to sample clients for evaluation.
  * ```on_evaluate_config_fn```: a function that returns a configuration dictionary which will be sent to the selected clients. The function will be called during each round and provides a convenient way to customize client-side evaluation from the server side, for example, to configure the number of validation steps performed.

```python
def evaluate_config(rnd: int):
    """Return evaluation configuration dict for each round.
    Perform five local evaluation steps on each client (i.e., use five
    batches) during rounds one to three, then increase to ten local
    evaluation steps.
    """
    val_steps = 5 if rnd < 4 else 10
    return {"val_steps": val_steps}

# Create strategy
strategy = fl.server.strategy.FedAvg(
    # ... other FedAvg agruments
    fraction_eval=0.2,
    min_eval_clients=2,
    min_available_clients=10,
    on_evaluate_config_fn=evaluate_config,
)

# Start Flower server for four rounds of federated learning
fl.server.start_server("[::]:8080", strategy=strategy)
```

### Saving Progress

The Flower server does not prescribe a way to persist model updates or evaluation results. Flower does not (yet) automatically save model updates on the server-side. It’s on the roadmap to provide a built-in way of doing this.

#### Model Checkpointing

Model updates can be persisted on the server-side by customizing _Strategy_ methods. Implementing custom strategies is always an option, but for many cases it may be more convenient to simply customize an existing strategy. The following code example defines a new `SaveModelStrategy` which customized the existing built-in _FedAvg_ strategy. In particular, it customizes _aggregate_fit_ by calling _aggregate_fit_ in the base class (FedAvg). It then continues to save returned (aggregated) weights before it returns those aggregated weights to the caller (i.e., the server):

```python
class SaveModelStrategy(fl.server.strategy.FedAvg):
    def aggregate_fit(
        self,
        rnd: int,
        results: List[Tuple[fl.server.client_proxy.ClientProxy, fl.common.FitRes]],
        failures: List[BaseException],
    ) -> Optional[fl.common.Weights]:
        aggregated_weights = super().aggregate_fit(rnd, results, failures)
        if aggregated_weights is not None:
            # Save aggregated_weights
            print(f"Saving round {rnd} aggregated_weights...")
            np.savez(f"round-{rnd}-weights.npz", *aggregated_weights)
        return aggregated_weights

# Create strategy and run server
strategy = SaveModelStrategy(
    # (same arguments as FedAvg here)
)
fl.server.start_server(strategy=strategy)
```
#### Aggregate Custom Evaluation Results
The same Strategy-customization approach can be used to aggregate custom evaluation results coming from individual clients. Clients can return custom metrics to the server by returning a dictionary:
```python
class Client(fl.client.NumPyClient):

    def get_parameters(self):
        # ...

    def fit(self, parameters, config):
        # ...

    def evaluate(self, parameters, config):
        """Evaluate parameters on the locally held test set."""

        # Update local model with global parameters
        self.model.set_weights(parameters)

        # Evaluate global model parameters on the local test data
        loss, accuracy = self.model.evaluate(self.x_test, self.y_test)

        # Return results, including the custom accuracy metric
        num_examples_test = len(self.x_test)
        return loss, num_examples_test, {"accuracy": accuracy}
```
The server can then use a customized strategy to aggregate the metrics provided in these dictionaries:

```python
class AggregateCustomMetricStrategy(fl.server.strategy.FedAvg):
    def aggregate_evaluate(
        self,
        rnd: int,
        results: List[Tuple[ClientProxy, EvaluateRes]],
        failures: List[BaseException],
    ) -> Optional[float]:
        """Aggregate evaluation losses using weighted average."""
        if not results:
            return None

        # Weigh accuracy of each client by number of examples used
        accuracies = [r.metrics["accuracy"] * r.num_examples for _, r in results]
        examples = [r.num_examples for _, r in results]

        # Aggregate and print custom metric
        accuracy_aggregated = sum(accuracies) / sum(examples)
        print(f"Round {rnd} accuracy aggregated from client results: {accuracy_aggregated}")

        # Call aggregate_evaluate from base class (FedAvg)
        return super().aggregate_evaluate(rnd, results, failures)

# Create strategy and run server
strategy = AggregateCustomMetricStrategy(
    # (same arguments as FedAvg here)
)
fl.server.start_server(strategy=strategy)
```

#### SSL-enabled Server and Client

Please, follow the following guide to learn how a SSL-enabled secure Flower server can be started and how a Flower client can establish a secure connection to it.

[`Guide: SSL-enabled Server and Client`](https://flower.dev/docs/ssl-enabled-connections.html)

## Skin Lesion Classification 

### Train the model in a federated setup

With both client and server ready, we can now run everything and see federated learning in action. FL systems usually have a server and multiple clients. We therefore have to start the server first:

[`server_advanced.py`](https://github.com/aidotse/decentralizedAI_dermatology/blob/master/server_advanced.py):    
 ```python server_advanced.py --path_data <> --r <Number of rounds for the federated training> --fc <Min fit clients, min number of clients to be sampled next round> --ac <Min available clients, min number of clients that need to connect to the server before training round can start>```
  The model is evaluated both centralized and in a decentralized manner. If you don’t want to perform centralized evaluation set `fraction_eval=0.0`.

Once the server is running we can start the clients in different terminals. Open a new terminal per client and start the client:

[`client_isic.py`](https://github.com/aidotse/decentralizedAI_dermatology/blob/master/client_isic.py) per terminal:
```python client_isic.py –-path <path> –-num_partitions <>  –-partition  <> –-gpu  <gpu ID>```

Note: Use `--nowandb` flag if you want to disable wandb logging.

### Local centralized training

To train the model in a centralized way in case you want to make a comparison, you can run: 

[`train_local.py`](https://github.com/aidotse/decentralizedAI_dermatology/blob/master/train_local.py)  
```python train_local.py –-path_data <path> –-num_partitions <>  –-partition  <> –-gpu  <gpu ID>```

Note: Use `--nowandb` flag if you want to disable wandb logging.


## Synthetic data generation of skin lesions

We trained StyleGAN2-ADA in a federated setup (using Flower), simulating 3 hospitals (clients) with limited data, in order to achieve a more diverse, realistic and fair dataset. 

Our setup consists of 3 clients with different ISIC partitions based on patient ID (we made sure that data from one patient wasn’t distributed amongst different clients).
The clients have different amount of data: 2k, 10k, 20k respectively (as above Exp 2.).

For StylGAN2-ADA implementation we used:

* Local Training in a centralized way: [NVlabs/stylegan2-ada-pytorch](https://github.com/aidotse/stylegan2-ada-pytorch)

* Training in a federated setup: [rosinality/stylegan2-pytorch](https://github.com/rosinality/stylegan2-pytorch)
  1. Launch [`server_advanced_gan.py`](https://github.com/aidotse/decentralizedAI_dermatology/blob/master/server_advanced_gan.py):    
 ```python server_advanced_gan.py --data <> --r <Number of rounds for the federated training> --fc <Min fit clients, min number of clients to be sampled next round> --ac <Min available clients, min number of clients that need to connect to the server before training round can start>```
  The model is evaluated in a decentralized manner. For some GANs parameters see the script.

  2. Launch one [`client_isic_gan.py`](https://github.com/aidotse/decentralizedAI_dermatology/blob/master/client_isic_gan.py) per terminal:
```python client_isic_gan.py –-data <path> –-num_partitions <>  –-partition  <> –gpu  <gpu ID>```

Note: Use `--wandb` flag if you want to enable wandb logging.

###  Requirements

To use this FL GAN setup first clone [rosinality/stylegan2-pytorch](https://github.com/rosinality/stylegan2-pytorch),
and install all dependences required for it with additional requirements for `flower framework`.
